FluentRenderTreeBuilder 1.0.1
=============================
The FluentRenderTreeBuilder wraps the built-in RenderTreeBuilder with a clean and fluent API for building Blazor components in pure C# code, and automatically generates source line based sequence numbers. See the examples pages and components in the test app provided in the source code repo on GitHub for more details.

When using the FluentRenderTreeBuilder, developers don't have to manually provide and maintain the sequence numbers or hand-write repetitive calls to the built-in RenderTreeBuilder.

The resulting markup code is identical to the razor compiler output with minor whitespace differences, and optionally output can be automatically minified by disabling the built-in 'pretty printing' feature, which is enabled by default to match the behaviour of Blazor's razor page compiler.

All feedback and suggestions are welcome. Thank you for taking a look at FluentRenderTreeBuilder!
